We use this file for storing our TODOs instead of the Github bugtracker because there seems to be no official way to export the issues there.
We don't want to rely upon Github as a single point of failure.

Critical TODOs:
- Process all TODO/FIXME/XXX entries in the actual perfect-flac-encode.sh or move them to this file if they cannot be resolved yet.
- Once we are in the release-candidate-phase, try ShellCheck: http://www.vidarholen.net/contents/shellcheck/

Non-critical TODOs:
- We should use EBU-R128 instead of standard Replaygain, but as of Kubuntu12.04 there seems to be no package which can do it.
- The unit test TEST_DAMAGE_TO_FLAC_SINGLETRACKS truncates the file instead of appending garbage because flac --test won't detect trailing garbage. While this works for our purposes, we should file a bug report at the FLAC bugtracker so they can fix it.
- We add versions of all used programs to the ENCODEDBY tag and the log. As of 2012-12-23, cueprint does not support printing its version number. So we instead add the package version of cuetools. Once the cueprint binary has a parameter to print the version, we should use that instead.

Non-critical new feature TODOs:
- On Kubuntu12.10 there is a standard bash alias called "alert" which can be used to deploy KDE notifications. We should use it for telling the user that encoding has finished.
