We use this file for storing our TODOs instead of the Github bugtracker because there seems to be no official way to export the issues there.
We don't want to rely upon Github as a single point of failure.

Critical TODOs:
<none>

Non-critical TODOs:
- When using grep on EAC LOG files we convert the input charset to UTF-8. The grep manpage is not clear about which input charset it expects. The REAMDE.md should tell the user that systems which are not configured for UTF-8 as default might cause problems.
- We should use EBU-R128 instead of standard Replaygain, but as of Kubuntu12.04 there seems to be no package which can do it.
- The unit test TEST_DAMAGE_TO_FLAC_SINGLETRACKS truncates the file instead of appending garbage because flac --test won't detect trailing garbage. While this works for our purposes, we should file a bug report at the FLAC bugtracker so they can fix it.
- We add versions of all used programs to the ENCODEDBY tag and the log. As of 2012-12-23, cueprint does not support printing its version number. So we instead add the package version of cuetools. Once the cueprint binary has a parameter to print the version, we should use that instead.
- shntool generates a "00 - pregap.wav" for HTOA. Decide what to do about this and check MusicBrainz for what they prefer. The options are: Keep as track 0, merge with track 1, shift all tracks by 1. I am against merging with track 1 since the hidden track is a different track than one.

Non-critical new feature TODOs:
- On Kubuntu12.10 there is a standard bash alias called "alert" which can be used to deploy KDE notifications. We should use it for telling the user that encoding has finished.
